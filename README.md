# Comment Edit History

Redmine plugin that keeps an audit trail of edited issue comments and exposes the previous revisions directly in the issue history.

Tested with Redmine 6.1 bookworm, 6.0.5, 5.0.3

## Features

- Captures every change made to the notes of an issue journal entry.
- Stores the full text of each revision alongside the editor and timestamp.
- Adds a toggleable panel under each updated comment so all users can review the prior versions.

## Installation

1. Copy the plugin into `plugins/comment_edit_history`.
2. Run the plugin migrations:

   ```bash
   bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:migrate NAME=comment_edit_history RAILS_ENV=production
   ```

3. Precompile/refresh the plugin assets (optional in development, required in production):

   ```bash
   bundle exec rake assets:precompile NAME=comment_edit_history RAILS_ENV=production
   ```

4. Restart Redmine.

## Usage

Once installed, edit any issue comment. A “Show comment edit history” link appears beneath the entry, exposing all recorded revisions.

The revision is only visible after page refresh.
